              <p>

              <p>
                It's essential to stand out as a Front-End Developer nowadays.
                Preparing a basic CV with the relevant front-end skills won't
                get you noticed by a recruiter or technical manager. Most web
                developers today don't have a degree in Computer Science and
                highly depend on work experience to get ahead in their careers.
                Before you try to sell yourself as a FED, make sure you have
                what it takes to become a good developer. What makes a great
                Front-End Developer? Firstly, having a clear and extensive 
                exper

              </p>
              <h1>What makes a great Front-End Developer?</h1>
              <p>
                Firstly, having a clear and extensive experience in working with
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is strongly advised to have a good
                understanding of design. Some of the best Front-End Developers
                out there have a background in UI/UX design and possess skills
                in creative problem-solving.
              </p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>
                Having an understanding of back-end development will help you go
                far as a Front-End Developer. Even if you're only working with
                the endpoints from the back-end, knowing what goes on under the
                hood of the API will help you develop your applications for
                scalability.

              <p>
                So with these points in place, what can you do to sell your
                experience and skills to potential employers? There are a few
                platforms that help Front-End Developers to promote their
                expertise.
              </p>
              <h1>Codepen</h1>
              <p>
                <img src="../images/codepen-start-coding.png" id="img-2">
                CodePen is an online editor sandbox for Front-End Developers.
                You can create a Pen, which are little projects using HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. Pens can be configured to include any libraries
                and preprocessors. One of my favourite features of CodePen is
                the Picked Pens section. You immediately see this when you land
                on the homepage. Your pen grows more popular by getting more
                views and likes. Add your best pens to your showcase, which you
                can add to your portfolio or show to an employer.
                
              </p>
              <h1>Github</h1>
              <p>
                <img src="../images/dark-mode.png" id="img-3">
                Github is the leading platform for open-source software.
                Contributing to open-source shows an employer that you work well
                with other developers and showcases projects and code you have
                written in the past. You can check this guide for how to start
                contributing to open-source software. You can also host your
                portfolio website on Github using Github Pages.
              </p>
              <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
              <p>
                Your website should tell employers a little about yourself. You
                should have links to all your platforms and a means for people
                to contact you. Most importantly, it should list the projects
                that you want employers to see. Remember that the portfolio
                needs to reflect the skills you are trying to sell. Make sure it
                works well on mobile, check that information is properly
                structured, and it looks clean and impressive.
              </p>
              <h1>Dribble</h1>
              <p>
                <img src="../images/dribble.png" id="img-4">
                Dribbble is a great place for developers with skills in UI
                design. It works much like CodePen, using shots rather than
                pens. Design shots for Dribbble, then create pens on CodePen.
                You will need an invitation to post shots on Dribbble. You can
                get one by asking a friend or colleague to send you one. You can
                also sign up for a Pro account or submit shots as drafts for
                review to receive an invitation.
              </p>
              <h1>Medium</h1>
              <p>
                <img src="../images/medium.png" id="img-5">
                Medium for writing articles and tutorials. Writing indicates
                thought leadership in your field. Your posts can help other
                developers who are on the same path as you.
              </p>
              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <p>
                When relying on your experience as a Front-End Developer,
                showcasing projects and work you have done is essential to stand
                out. Make your website has links to all your platforms.
