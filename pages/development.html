        Lazy loading is a technique that loads content or media only when it is
        needed or it is in the viewport. For images, this is usually called
        off-screen images. When the user gets close to an image, the browser
        loads the image instead of loading it when the user lands on the page.

        Using images in your website slows down its performance. This gets worse
        if you have many images on your web page. Users are impatient and most
        leave a site immediately if it takes more than 5 seconds to load. How
        can we solve this issue regardless of how many images we use on a web
        page? Lazy loading is a technique that loads content or media only when
        it is needed or it is in the viewport. For images, this is usually
        called off-screen images. When the user gets close to an image, the
        browser loads the image instead of loading it when the user lands on the
        page. This lets the page load much faster because it only needs to load
        images that are currently in view. To achieve this, we set the src of an
        img to data-src. When the browser gets to the image, it sees no src and
        ignores the image instead. Later, when we add src to the image, the
        browser starts downloading that image. So when the image gets close to
        the viewport, we simply set the src of an image to the data-src value:
        <br />
        <b
          >const image = document.querySelector('.myImg');
          image.setAttribute('src', image.getAttribute('data-src');</b
        >

        That’s great, but how do we know when the image is in the viewport?
        Intersection Observer API Using the Intersection Observer API, we can
        observe images that have an attribute of data-src. Using a threshold, we
        can detect if an image comes into the viewport, and then run a callback
        in which we assign the image's data-src to it's src. Then inside that
        callback, we tell the observer to stop observing that image. First, we
        set up the observer:<br />
        <b
          >const imageObs = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => { //
          handle entries }, { // options });</b
        >

      <h1>
        The Intersection Observer takes 2 arguments. The first is a callback
        function, which receives a list of entry objects and the observer
        itself, and the second is an object of options. In the callback
        function, we loop through all the entries and check if that entry is in
        the viewport:<br />
        <b>entries.forEach(entry => { if(entry.isIntersecting) { } });</b>
      </h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="bg"></div>
      <h1>
        Inside, we get a reference to the image’s DOM node from the entry. And
        we set the image’s src to the image's data-src. const target =
        entry.target; target.src = target.getAttribute('data-src');
      </h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="bg"></div>
      <h1>
        We then add a class to the image when it has loaded, and tell the
        observer to stop observing the image. The loaded class is useful when
        you want to animate in the image once it enters the viewport and it is
        loaded:<br> 
        <b>target.onload = () => { target.classList.add('loaded');
        observer.unobserve(target); }</b>
      </h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="bg"></div>
      <h1>
        In IntersectionObserver’s second argument, we pass an object of options.
        Here we define a threshold and a rootMargin. The threshold tells the
        observer to fire when the image is 5% in the viewport. The rootMargin
        sets an offset for when the observer should fire:<br> 
        <b>const imageObs = new
        IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => { entries.forEach(entry => {
        if(entry.isIntersecting) { const target = entry.target; target.src =
        target.getAttribute('data-src'); target.onload = () => {
        target.classList.add('loaded'); observer.unobserve(target); } } }); }, {
        threshold: 0.05, rootMargin: '48px' });</b>
      </h1>

        The Intersection Observer API makes such tasks a whole lot easier today.
        It is supported in most modern browsers at the time of writing this
        article. However, it does not support Internet Explorer. There is a
        polyfill on NPM which implements backward support for the Intersecting
        Observer in IE. Image lazy-loading has a huge impact on improving your
        site’s performance. Google’s Lighthouse also recommends deferring
        offscreen images using the Intersection Observer API.
